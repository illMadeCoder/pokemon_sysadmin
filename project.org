** days
A day is a set of exercises for the player to accomplish together and
are ordered in way that any exercises on day N should introduce some
small set of new sysadmin skills along with any necessary new files to
work with but also be safely dependent on any state and skills
produced in a previous day.
*** import/export
Each day will be expressed and tested for the user with a set of pair
folders import and export. Where import will contain the neccessary
files to enage a new exercise and export will be where any exercise
solutions are stored for day completion testing.
*** exercise test
An automated test runs when a day is completed to determine if all
exercises are completed successfully.
